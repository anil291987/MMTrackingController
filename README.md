TrackingController
==================

This is the TrackingController code which can be used to easily manage multiple iOS analytics packages. Included in this code are configurations for [Flurry](http://www.flurry.com), [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics), and [Localytics](http://www.localytics.com). It should be easy to adapt this to most new analytics APIs.
